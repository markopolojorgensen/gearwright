Coastal individuals live relatively normal lives yet some of them follow the calling of becoming a Fisher. Either to provide for their communities or because they seek the thrill and adventure."

Resilient against the horrors the ocean has to offer they may not be as adept at piloting their Gears as Fishers from different backgrounds."
