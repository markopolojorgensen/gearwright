  tab switcher - narrative profile
    labels descriptor equipment

  zoom font changes
    maybe make everything huge and then always be scaling down?
      i.e. quit pre-shrinking the assets?

  show known saves on main menu

  warn when data would be lost (keep track of most recent save)
    exit
    return to main menu
    load
    new fish / new gear

  edit .json files (most recent is in discord dms from 12throot)
    burnout ap cost should be 0, not "x"
    custom background description
    pinned discord message...?
  done
    galvanic_capacitor ap_cost should be 0, not "0" in item_data.json
    scrubber needs the same "\n" treatment as line linker in item_data.json
    `"speed": 1,` needs to be added to lightweight_construction in fisher_developments.json
    lightweight construction / ballast fish mutation / gas pockets
      "Lightweight Construction
        Gain +1 Speed. After your Gearâ€™s final BALLAST has been determined, reduce it by 1."
    siltstalker -> siltstalker_leviathan
    abberant -> aberrant (fish template and developments)

  fancy custom ux for totd/injuries?
    injuries
      todo: list all the stuff injuries can change
      ballast?
      close/far/mental/power/ballast/ap? (temporary)
      close/far? (permanent)
    touch of the deep
      todo: list all the stuff totd can change
    other stuff I'm missing?

  undo/redo?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- wontfix / distant future / nonissues
  shouldn't crash if fed garbage save files (e.g. "cam" instead of "optics")
  go through all FIXMEs / TODOs / WHEREWASIs
  too many different fish internals is a bit jank
  right clicking to inspect has some problems
    the popup always stays within the edges of the screen, but if you mouse over the popup it will disappear (or if the popup pops up under your mouse) as soon as you release right click
    right clicking empty spaces sometimes gives you popup of the item whose aabb overlaps that empty space
      also causes problems since multiple items can occupy the same space

  what is the difference between numbers vs no_numbers genie export?

  power saving / performance mode?

  UI polish pass
  startup time seems a bit slow

  =QUALITY ASSURANCE=

  X Ralf goes through everything and sees if all the stats are correct for everything and if everything is there, some developments are missing for example.

  =IF SANTA IS GOOD TO ME THIS YEAR=

  X I am commissioning Terrain for Fathomless Gears, coupled with the fact that its a simple square grid and that all maps are 20x20 and all terrain pieces are
  rectangles it really shouldn't be to hard to throw a map editor into the program. It would be the cherry on top of everything.

  Do you want a "battle" mode, where you can track all the stuff you currently track by drawing Xs on stuff in real time?
    (it would be a pretty sizeable undertaking)
    no

  sort fish internal legend by type (color)
    unnecessary



DONE
  Curio disclaimer
  hovering over weight causes all equipped internals to display their weight
  Loading fish doesn't cause weird behavior with "Mutations remaining" (was already fixed)
  fish internal number bubbles are now toggleable
  internals no longer become inaccessible or un-selectable because of other internals' funky shapes
  fish editor legend shrinks text if there's too many internals
  don't let players take repeat developments (exception A Brush With The Deep)
  don't let players take repeat manuevers
  don't let players take repeat deep words
  color coded development/maneuver/deepword info header
  right click on developments/maneuvers/deepwords in gear builder to see what they do
  bonus manuever from 6 mental is limited to mental maneuvers
  non-standard fisher adjustments
    spinboxes along the side of the stats thing
    "Fisher stats need to be freely adjustable as Fishers can regularly pick up stat-increases during campaign play, decreases are also possible."
    deep word count should be manually adjustable to support campaign progression unlocks
    developments & maneuvers are also now freely adjustable because why not
    save/load saves and loads these
2.2.0
  new core integrity & repair kit icons
  new .fsh file
  put weight & unlocks in stats block
  trim newline on stat explanation
  massive fish internal scale wasn't set correctly
  custom background should use "+" instead of "x"
  more than nine repair kits shouldn't break the editor
2.1.0
  make building smaller fish feel better, probably needs smaller scale
  Reset Internals on the Fish should also Reset fish Template and its bonuses to "Common"
  "enforce tags" toggle
  move weight cap and weight underneath unlocks
  new assets for repair kits & core integrity
  multiple "A Brush With The Deep" developments should give you multiple deep words
  Mutation stat bonuses should add to the BASE stat, they should not be counted as a bonus. The Fish can't ever lose these mutations mid encounter so its easier to just add them to base.
  pngs don't get exported with name bar selected (was already working)
  unduplicate popups & popup ICs from mech & fish builder
  custom fisher backgrounds work again
  clicking on popups no longer causes you to pick up internals behind the popup
  new fish gear section art assets
  new character gear section art assets
  organize files
  yeet all commented code / finish refactor
2.0.1
  text size shenanigans
2.0.0
  test 4.3 program export
  investigate fish save/load for fishes of all sizes / types
  fsh archive changes (fragile optic rotation, cam -> optics, grid changes)
  Ii -> II the names have been in the item_data the whole time /)_(\
  permanent perk ux
  Bulky Internals can't be installed next to other Bulky Internals (Diagonally or otherwise)
  optics tag limit
  engine tag limit
  unwieldy tag limit
  ballast shenanigans
    ballast can only be 1-10
    lightweight construction / fish mutation / gas pockets should all apply AFTER weight calculation
    so weight 55 -> ballast 10 -> lightweight -> ballast 9
  "enforce weight cap" toggle should work
  "enforce unlocks" toggle should work
  "Stat Total" text in stats display
  too many unlocks used (like from lowering a level) should cause a red font and an exclamation mark
  reset unlocks / reset internals shouldn't cause crashes
  program shouldn't crash if you try to use it without loading data
  consolidate gear section ids
  new colors
    Passive Internals: HTML: 753706
    Active Internals: HTML: 215328
    FAR Internals: HTML: 204050
    CLOSE Internals: HTML: 452255
    MENTAL Internals: 572129
    MITIGATION: Html: 454545
    right click info headers
    fish internal legend backings
  Developments shouldn't cause widening
  lose background in stats display
  fish legend -> Underlay the names of the Fish Internals with the color that they are (purple, pink, orange, green, blue)
  align buttons along the top menu bar in fisher & fish editor
  "Math" -> "Breakdown"
  stats/internals header font size increase?
  warning message riser should start about 16 pixels higher
  9 repair jolly roger / repair kits box that mirrors gear ability box
  align lots of things (see discord pinned message)
  cut background from callsign summary
  no need for gap between background and developments
  background/developments/maneuvers/deepwords box on the left, gear in the middle, stats on the right
  go all the way through this document
  Fisher saves shouldn't have overlapping internals (discarded internals are not consistently removed from the file)
  leviathan grid section names
  tidy up fish legend
  curio internals should always be visible
  Sort Gear Internals with sub-headers per section ( Weapons, Active, Passive, etc)
  fish column headers are less garbo
  Fisher stat box should be inside the Fisher Mech - Screenshot rectangle
  fun li'l floating warning when you try to do something forbidden
  Limited
  fish mutation editing box is less messy
  where does that .fsh file come from
    it's a bunch of files zipped up
    are you editing all these json files by hand?
      yes, and it needs more changes
  fish builder and gear builder now use the same inventory system, thank christ
  learned how assets are handled (what the pck is for)
  overall layout changed
  stats list realignment
  save file shenanigans
  hide all the spacers
  adjust zoom levels so exports play nice, don't worry about scrolling internals
  thorn spitter iv -> legend number placement is not inside the internal, eep
  multiline leviathan serpent
  fish size gear section configs grrr
    serpent
    siltstalker
    leviathan
    the others
  some way to clear currently selected internal (right click?) (this already works mark you dummy)
  Stat list now shows breakdown on hover
  non-head sections grey out if you pick up a head internal, same for all internals/sections
  li'l slot hover hightlight
  old mech builder moved into top level mech builder script
  emit_signal("whatever") -> whatever.emit()
  download export templates


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gearwright data archive

gearwright data

it's a zip file renamed to .fsh
inside there's a bunch of json files and _assets.pck
  that's where all the sprites are stored
  need godot gre tools to make that pck, I suppose?
  maybe not, but whatever

originally it was a ctr-a -> send to zip situation
no top-level folder in the archive

I changed that recently by accident


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LESSONS
Label's mouse_entered and mouse_exited cause flickering...?
  if you do want to use built-in mouse signals, don't forget mouse_filter:
    label.mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_PASS

z_index influences when a node is drawn, but it does not influence the order in which nodes receive gui inputs
  if you want a control to be in front of other controls (and get input events before them) it's not enough to set the z_index
  reorder the tree to get the control "in front" of other input-consuming nodes (i.e. lower in the Scene dock)
  after that is determined, you can mess with z_index all you like to get the look you want

Maybe you should learn about the Popup class, huh?
