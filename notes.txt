TODO
Q1 2025, definitely before May

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEXT VERSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SMOL
json changes
  stab clamps
  anemone gear ability
  derringer trait
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIOM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MYSTERY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LORGE





------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME FUTURE VERSION






------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- wontfix / distant future / nonissues
  make export smaller to allow google to scan it for viruses? No


  non-windows versions?

  fancy custom ux for totd/injuries?
    injuries
      todo: list all the stuff injuries can change
      ballast?
      close/far/mental/power/ballast/ap? (temporary)
      close/far? (permanent)
    touch of the deep
      todo: list all the stuff totd can change
    other stuff I'm missing?

  undo/redo?

  shouldn't crash if fed garbage save files (e.g. "cam" instead of "optics")
  go through all FIXMEs / TODOs / WHEREWASIs
  too many different fish internals is a bit jank
  right clicking to inspect has some problems
    the popup always stays within the edges of the screen, but if you mouse over the popup it will disappear (or if the popup pops up under your mouse) as soon as you release right click
    right clicking empty spaces sometimes gives you popup of the item whose aabb overlaps that empty space
      also causes problems since multiple items can occupy the same space

  what is the difference between numbers vs no_numbers genie export?

  power saving / performance mode?

  UI polish pass
  startup time seems a bit slow

  =QUALITY ASSURANCE=

  X Ralf goes through everything and sees if all the stats are correct for everything and if everything is there, some developments are missing for example.

  =IF SANTA IS GOOD TO ME THIS YEAR=

  X I am commissioning Terrain for Fathomless Gears, coupled with the fact that its a simple square grid and that all maps are 20x20 and all terrain pieces are
  rectangles it really shouldn't be to hard to throw a map editor into the program. It would be the cherry on top of everything.

  Do you want a "battle" mode, where you can track all the stuff you currently track by drawing Xs on stuff in real time?
    (it would be a pretty sizeable undertaking)
    no

  sort fish internal legend by type (color)
    unnecessary

  fish builder and gear builder now use the same inventory system, thank christ
  learned how assets are handled (what the pck is for)
  overall layout changed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gearwright data archive

gearwright data

it's a zip file renamed to .fsh
inside there's a bunch of json files
and _assets.pck
  that's where all the sprites are stored
  need godot gre tools to make that pck, I suppose?
  maybe not, but whatever

originally it was a ctr-a -> send to zip situation
no top-level folder in the archive

I changed that recently by accident


to edit:
  get the previous version of the .fsh file
  .fsh -> .zip
  unzip (7zip -> Extract Here)
  make edits

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LESSONS
Label's mouse_entered and mouse_exited cause flickering...?
  if you do want to use built-in mouse signals, don't forget mouse_filter:
    label.mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_PASS

z_index influences when a node is drawn, but it does not influence the order in which nodes receive gui inputs
  if you want a control to be in front of other controls (and get input events before them) it's not enough to set the z_index
  reorder the tree to get the control "in front" of other input-consuming nodes (i.e. lower in the Scene dock)
  after that is determined, you can mess with z_index all you like to get the look you want

Maybe you should learn about the Popup class, huh?
