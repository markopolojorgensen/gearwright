TODO
Q1 2025, definitely before May

big things still to do
  finish refactor
  revive fish editor



Questions
  numbers vs no_numbers export?
  power saving mode?
  permission to align stats list left and right instead of all centered?
  how attached are you to current crunchy visual look, are rounded corners okay?





too many unlocks used (like from lowering a level) should cause a red font and an exclamation mark

UI polish pass
yeet all commented code

Fish data missing artwork, all fucked up

show known saves (duh)

tab switcher - narrative profile
  labels descriptor equipment

fish builder is actually a copy paste of gear builder -_-

where does that .fsh file come from
  zipped up bunch of files
  are you editing all these json files by hand?

program shouldn't crash if you try to use it without loading data
startup time seems a bit slow?
fish creator does weird things with internals

probably about a million little QoL things
  fish mutation editing box is messy
  hovering over weight should cause all equipped internals to display their weight
  some way to clear currently selected internal (right click?) (this already works mark you dummy)

test 4.3 program export

right click on developments and maneuvers in gear builder?

warn when data would be lost
  exit w/out saving
  ->main menu w/out saving
  load w/out saving

hovering over stats should show calculation / sources breakdown

maneuvers don't check to make sure bonus mental maneuver is actually a mental one





=GENERAL CREATION=

X Limited - Some Internals can only be installed X times, Gearwright should not let you install more.

X Bulky - Bulky Internals can't be installed next to other Bulky Internals (Diagonally or otherwise) this might be the hardest thing, Genie
was unsure if she could do it. Having this feature would be really really strong.


=MECH CREATION=

X Adjust the Fisher stat box to be inside the Fisher Mech - Screenshot rectangle

X Sort Gear Internals with sub-headers per section ( Weapons, Active, Passive, etc)

X Developments and Maneuvers and Deepwords need to be right-clickable so you can see what they do

X Fisher stats need to be freely adjustable as Fishers can regularly pick up stat-increases during campaign play, decreases are also possible.

X Curio Internals are currently only visible when you take the development to take one, they should always be visible. Maybe make them only equippable when you take the development.
Curios are also obtainable outside of the development though so that also needs to be an option. Perhaps a disclaimer in the curio section is enough and they are freely available

X Deep Words are currently only available via Developments, Fishers sometimes are able to pick up Deep-Words via progression during Campaign play so they need to be more accessible during creation.

X gear builder: weight cap & weight -> top right under unlocks
remove weight cap & weight from bottom right


=FISH CREATION=

X Created Fish have little number bubbles on their internals so they can be associated with their names in the legend.
- > Can the numbers be smaller? Right now they are covering a bunch of the artwork. - If not, the number bubble must be moved for some internals,
otherwise it covers critical parts of the art.
- > Make number bubbles toggle-able. Turn them on and off

X Fish Legend
-> Some names of some internals are all over the place, the fish part legend just doesnt look neat at all currently
we can make the names of some fish internals shorter but overall this just needs to be tidier.
-> Underlay the names of the Fish Internals with the color that they are (purple, pink, orange, green, blue)

X Leviathans are multi-grid fish
-> in Gearwright their grids are currently named section 1, 2 and 3 etc. In the rules we have labeled them as body parts with distinct names.

X When making a Screenshot of a Fish it should automatically de-select the name bar. perhaps there is a different way to export a PNG other than screenshot.

X Reset Internals on the Fish should also Reset fish Template and its bonuses to "Common".


=QUALITY ASSURANCE=

X Ralf goes through everything and sees if all the stats are correct for everything and if everything is there, some developments are missing for example.


=BUG FIXES=

X Internals that have a weird shape that leaves many spaces inside them open overlay internals with their empty spaces, making it impossible to click these "integrated" internals.

X Loading a fish with a template will set the "Mutations remaining" value to max (even if you have already spent the mutations).

X Fisher advancements are not displayed when loading a save

X Fisher saves can still have overlapping internals (discarded internals are not consistently removed from the file)


=IF SANTA IS GOOD TO ME THIS YEAR=

X I am commissioning Terrain for Fathomless Gears, coupled with the fact that its a simple square grid and that all maps are 20x20 and all terrain pieces are
rectangles it really shouldn't be to hard to throw a map editor into the program. It would be the cherry on top of everything.

Do you want a "battle" mode, where you can track all the stuff you currently track by drawing Xs on stuff in real time?
  (it would be a pretty sizeable undertaking)




NEW FEATURES LIST
  Stat list now shows breakdown on hover
  non-head sections grey out if you pick up a head internal, same for all internals/sections
  li'l slot hover hightlight
OTHER DONE STUFF
  old mech builder moved into top level mech builder script
  emit_signal("whatever") -> whatever.emit()
  download export templates
