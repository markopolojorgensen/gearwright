TODO
Q1 2025, definitely before May


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEXT VERSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SMOL
"Total" text in stats display
Developments shouldn't cause widening
  loading a fisher shouldn't have internals off-grid until second update
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MEDIOM
new colors
  Passive Internals: HTML: 753706
  Active Internals: HTML: 215328
  FAR Internals: HTML: 204050
  CLOSE Internals: HTML: 452255
  MENTAL Internals: 572129
  right click info headers
  fish internal legend backings
consolidate gear section ids
program shouldn't crash if you try to use it without loading data
reset unlocks / reset internals shouldn't cause crashes
too many unlocks used (like from lowering a level) should cause a red font and an exclamation mark
ballast shenanigans
  ballast can only be 1-10
  lightweight construction / fish mutation / gas pockets should all apply AFTER weight calculation
  so weight 55 -> ballast 10 -> lightweight -> ballast 9
Bulky Internals can't be installed next to other Bulky Internals (Diagonally or otherwise)
optics tag limit
investigate fish save/load for fishes of all sizes / types
multiple "A Brush With The Deep" developments should give you multiple deep words
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LORGE
yeet all commented code / finish refactor
go through all FIXMEs / TODOs / WHEREWASIs
switch to InputContext framework
  permanently unbork custom background editing
  unbork trying to edit fish export name
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MYSTERY
test 4.3 program export


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DONE
lose background in stats display
fish legend -> Underlay the names of the Fish Internals with the color that they are (purple, pink, orange, green, blue)
align buttons along the top menu bar in fisher & fish editor
"Math" -> "Breakdown"
stats/internals header font size increase?
warning message riser should start about 16 pixels higher
9 repair jolly roger / repair kits box that mirrors gear ability box
align lots of things (see discord pinned message)
cut background from callsign summary
no need for gap between background and developments
background/developments/maneuvers/deepwords box on the left, gear in the middle, stats on the right











------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SOME FUTURE VERSION
bonus manuever from 6 mental needs to be limited to mental maneuvers
zoom font changes
  maybe make everything huge and then always be scaling down?
    i.e. quit pre-shrinking the assets?

incorporate new assets for gear sections (waiting on assets)
  fishers and fish alike

non-standard fisher adjustments
  "Fisher stats need to be freely adjustable as Fishers can regularly pick up stat-increases during campaign play, decreases are also possible."
  injuries
    todo: list all the stuff injuries can change
    ballast?
    close/far/mental/power/ballast/ap? (temporary)
    close/far? (permanent)
  touch of the deep
    todo: list all the stuff totd can change
  deep word count should be manually adjustable to support campaign progression unlocks
  other stuff I'm missing?

tab switcher - narrative profile
  labels descriptor equipment

warn when data would be lost (keep track of most recent save)
  exit
  return to main menu
  load
  new fish / new gear

edit .json files
  custom background description
  lightweight construction / ballast fish mutation / gas pockets
  "Lightweight Construction
    Gain +1 Speed. After your Gearâ€™s final BALLAST has been determined, reduce it by 1."
  pinned discord message

ask ralf about this:
  gear builder: weight cap & weight -> top right under unlocks
  remove weight cap & weight from bottom right

right click on developments/maneuvers/deepwords in gear builder to see what they do
show known saves (duh)
hovering over weight should cause all equipped internals to display their weight
curio disclaimer "Curios are only obtainable via Development or GM Fiat"
fish internal number bubbles should be toggleable
don't export pngs with name bar selected (I think this is already working, double check)
Reset Internals on the Fish should also Reset fish Template and its bonuses to "Common".
sometimes an internal is un-selectable / un-right-clickable because another internal's shape completely occludes it
Loading a fish with a template should not set the "Mutations remaining" value to max (when you have already spent the mutations)
Fisher advancements should be displayed when loading a save


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- wontfix / distant future / nonissues

right clicking to inspect has some problems
  the popup always stays within the edges of the screen, but if you mouse over the popup it will disappear (or if the popup pops up under your mouse) as soon as you release right click
  right clicking empty spaces sometimes gives you popup of the item whose aabb overlaps that empty space
    also causes problems since multiple items can occupy the same space

Questions
  numbers vs no_numbers export?
  power saving / performance mode?

godot theme???
UI polish pass
startup time seems a bit slow?

=QUALITY ASSURANCE=

X Ralf goes through everything and sees if all the stats are correct for everything and if everything is there, some developments are missing for example.

=IF SANTA IS GOOD TO ME THIS YEAR=

X I am commissioning Terrain for Fathomless Gears, coupled with the fact that its a simple square grid and that all maps are 20x20 and all terrain pieces are
rectangles it really shouldn't be to hard to throw a map editor into the program. It would be the cherry on top of everything.

Do you want a "battle" mode, where you can track all the stuff you currently track by drawing Xs on stuff in real time?
  (it would be a pretty sizeable undertaking)
  no





DONE

  go all the way through this document
  Fisher saves shouldn't have overlapping internals (discarded internals are not consistently removed from the file)
  leviathan grid section names
  tidy up fish legend
  curio internals should always be visible
  Sort Gear Internals with sub-headers per section ( Weapons, Active, Passive, etc)
  fish column headers are less garbo
  Fisher stat box should be inside the Fisher Mech - Screenshot rectangle
  fun li'l floating warning when you try to do something forbidden
  Limited
  fish mutation editing box is less messy
  where does that .fsh file come from
    it's a bunch of files zipped up
    are you editing all these json files by hand?
      yes, and it needs more changes
  fish builder and gear builder now use the same inventory system, thank christ
  learned how assets are handled (what the pck is for)
  overall layout changed
  stats list realignment
  save file shenanigans
  hide all the spacers
  adjust zoom levels so exports play nice, don't worry about scrolling internals
  thorn spitter iv -> legend number placement is not inside the internal, eep
  multiline leviathan serpent
  fish size gear section configs grrr
    serpent
    siltstalker
    leviathan
    the others
  some way to clear currently selected internal (right click?) (this already works mark you dummy)



NEW FEATURES LIST
  Stat list now shows breakdown on hover
  non-head sections grey out if you pick up a head internal, same for all internals/sections
  li'l slot hover hightlight
OTHER DONE STUFF
  old mech builder moved into top level mech builder script
  emit_signal("whatever") -> whatever.emit()
  download export templates
